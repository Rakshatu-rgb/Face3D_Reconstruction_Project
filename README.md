🧠 Deep 3D Face Reconstruction using Neural Rendering & Morphable Models
This project reconstructs a realistic 3D model of a human face from a single 2D image using Deep Learning and Neural Rendering. It combines:

ResNet Backbones

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)

3D Morphable Models (3DMM)

Neural Rendering

Chumpy optimization

to generate high-quality 3D face outputs.

💡 Problem Statement
Generating 3D face geometry from a 2D image is a challenging problem used in:

🎮 Animation & Gaming

🎭 Virtual Reality (VR) & Augmented Reality (AR)

🔐 Biometric Authentication

🎥 Digital Avatars & Film FX

🔧 How to Run
bash
Copy code
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the main script
python main/main.py --input test_image.jpg
📌 Notes
Make sure epoch_20.pth is in the checkpoints/ folder.

Use tools like MeshLab or Blender to view .obj output.
